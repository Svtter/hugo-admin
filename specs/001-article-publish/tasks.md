# Tasks: Article Publishing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-article-publish/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Included - feature specification includes comprehensive acceptance scenarios requiring test coverage

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web application**: Flask app at repository root, services/ in services/, templates/ in templates/
- **Tests**: tests/ directory with existing test structure
- All paths shown are absolute paths from repository root

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project setup and preparation for article publishing feature

- [ ] T001 Create backup of current working state before implementing feature
- [ ] T002 Verify python-frontmatter dependency is available in requirements.txt
- [ ] T003 Review existing PostService structure and identify extension points
- [ ] T004 [P] Review existing API structure in app.py to understand endpoint patterns
- [ ] T005 [P] Review existing template structure in templates/ to understand UI patterns

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core service layer extensions that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T006 Add publish_article method to PostService in services/post_service.py
- [ ] T007 Add bulk_publish_articles method to PostService in services/post_service.py
- [ ] T008 Add get_publish_status method to PostService in services/post_service.py
- [ ] T009 Add file locking helper methods to PostService for concurrency handling
- [ ] T010 Add frontmatter validation helpers to PostService in services/post_service.py
- [ ] T011 Add file path validation helpers to PostService in services/post_service.py

**Checkpoint**: PostService foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

- [ ] T023 [US1] Add publish status display element in templates/editor.html
- [ ] T024 [US1] Add error handling and user feedback for publish operations in templates/editor.html

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Visual Publish Status Indicators (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Add visual badges in article list to show draft vs published status

**Independent Test**: Can load article list and verify draft and published articles have distinct visual indicators

### Tests for User Story 2

- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Create test_status_api.py with test_get_bulk_article_status

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### Story Dependencies
```
Phase 2 (Foundational) → Phase 3 (US1) → {Phase 4 (US2), Phase 5 (US3)} → Phase 6 (Polish)
```

**Key Dependencies**:
- **Phase 2** blocks ALL user stories (PostService extensions required)
- **US1 (P1)** blocks US2 and US3 (publish functionality is prerequisite)
- **US2** and **US3** can be developed in parallel after US1 is complete
- **Phase 6** depends on all user stories being complete

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:
- T004, T005 can run in parallel (review existing code)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T006, T007, T008 can run in parallel (different PostService methods)
- T009, T010, T011 can run in parallel (different helper methods)

**Phase 3 (US1)**:
- T012, T013, T014, T015, T016 can run in parallel (test creation)
- T019, T020, T021, T022, T023, T024 can run in parallel (UI components)

**Phase 4 (US2)**:
- T025, T026 can run in parallel (test creation)
- T028, T029, T030, T031 can run in parallel (UI components)

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- T032, T033, T034 can run in parallel (test creation)
- T036, T037, T038, T039, T040, T041 can run in parallel (UI components)

**Phase 6 (Polish)**:
- Most tasks can run in parallel as they address different aspects

### Implementation Strategy

**MVP First**: Deliver User Story 1 (Phase 3) as MVP - this provides core publish functionality

**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story phase delivers complete, independently testable functionality

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Start with PostService extensions (Phase 2) to validate technical approach
- Focus on file locking and error handling early to avoid concurrency issues
- Test with real Hugo content to ensure compatibility

### Success Criteria

**Phase Completion**:
- Each phase completes with working, testable functionality
- All acceptance scenarios from specification are covered
- Performance requirements met (<3 second publish time)
- Error handling covers all identified edge cases

**Feature Complete**:
- All user stories implemented and tested
- Production-ready with comprehensive error handling
- Documentation complete
- Performance optimized for target scale (hundreds of articles)

- US1 (P1): 15 tasks (including tests)
