## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-14

- Q: Build trigger integration scope - What specific functionality should be added for article publishing? → A: Add publish button in article editor interface to change draft status
- Q: Publish button location - Where should the publish button be placed in the UI? → A: In article editor interface (near save/save as)
- Q: Core publishing mechanism - How should publishing work? → A: When user clicks publish, change draft: true to draft: false (existing trigger builder handles builds)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Publish Article from Editor (Priority: P1)

As a blog administrator, I want to publish articles directly from the editor interface so that I can quickly make content available to readers without leaving the editing workflow.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested - provides seamless publishing workflow without needing manual file editing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by publishing an article and verifying the draft status changes correctly in the file.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am editing an article with `draft: true`, **When** I click the publish button, **Then** the article's frontmatter changes to `draft: false`
2. **Given** I publish an article successfully, **When** I check the file content, **Then** only the draft status changes, other content remains unchanged
3. **Given** I click publish on an already published article, **When** the operation completes, **Then** I see a message indicating the article is already published

### User Story 2 - Visual Publish Status Indicators (Priority: P2)

As a blog administrator, I want to see clear visual indicators of article publish status in the editor and list views so that I can quickly identify which articles are published vs drafts.

**Why this priority**: Essential for content management - users need immediate visual feedback about article status.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the interface and verifying that draft and published articles have distinct visual indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the article list, **When** I look at draft articles, **Then** I see a "Draft" badge or indicator
2. **Given** I am viewing the article list, **When** I look at published articles, **Then** I see a "Published" badge or indicator
3. **Given** I am editing an article, **When** I view the editor interface, **Then** the publish button reflects the current draft status

---

### User Story 3 - Bulk Publishing Operations (Priority: P3)

As a blog administrator, I want to publish multiple articles at once from the list view so that I can efficiently manage batch content releases.

**Why this priority**: Useful for content management workflows where multiple articles need to be published simultaneously.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting multiple draft articles and publishing them in one operation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple draft articles selected, **When** I click bulk publish, **Then** all selected articles change from draft to published
2. **Given** I perform bulk publishing, **When** the operation completes, **Then** I see a summary of how many articles were successfully published
3. **Given** some articles fail to publish during bulk operation, **When** I view the results, **Then** I see which articles failed and why

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an article file doesn't have frontmatter with draft status?
- How does system handle concurrent publish requests on the same article?
- What happens when publish operation fails due to file permissions?
- How does system handle articles with malformed YAML frontmatter?
- What happens when the article file is deleted during publish operation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
